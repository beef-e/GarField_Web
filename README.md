# GarField

GarField is a simple electron app engineered to easily take notes in class as a student.
The purpose is to allow the user to take markdown-like notes without ever touching the mouse.

The cool thing? [Cornell note-taking system](https://lsc.cornell.edu/how-to-study/taking-notes/cornell-note-taking-system/).

## Installation

There is still no official way to download the app. You can copy the repo and use electron manually to see it in action

```bash
git clone https://github.com/beef-e/GarField_Web.git
cd GarField_Web
npm start
```

## Usage

Once the app is ready, choose a title to your note and start typing. You can use the tab key to choose the block you want to use or even try the shortcuts to boost your speed even more.

To switch to Cornell mode, use `CTR+ALT+P`
